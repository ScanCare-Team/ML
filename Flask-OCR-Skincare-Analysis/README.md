# Skincare Ingredient Detection

This is a Flask-based web application designed to detect hazardous materials in skincare ingredients using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). It also predicts skin types based on ingredient analysis using a machine learning model.

## Features

- **OCR Processing**: Extracts text from skincare product images using EasyOCR. The app can process both English and Indonesian text.
- **Hazardous Materials Detection**: Compares the extracted ingredient list with a database of known hazardous materials and provides analysis.
- **Skin Type Prediction**: Predicts skin types (e.g., combination, dry, oily, sensitive) based on the list of skincare ingredients using a machine learning model.
